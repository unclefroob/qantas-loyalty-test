# Ryan's Coding Challenge

Hi! This is my take on your coding challenge. I've spent around 4 hours working on it, and obviously it is not pixel perfect as instructed but I think it's a solid representation of how it could be interpreted.

## Starting the Project

To start the app, navigate to the root folder and run:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

If you want to run the tests, run:

```
yarn test
```

## Notes and Considerations

- This project was created using a Vite boilerplate. I believed that the purpose of this test was more holistic, so I wanted to spend more time writing components and tests rather than Webpack setup.

- Some pieces of data would be Enums if the typescript types were generated by a live API. In this case they are handled as Strings (i.e. cancellationType) to simplify type handling.

- Sorting is done in the front-end. In general this is not common practice as it would be done through a database query or in the backend for performance reasons.
